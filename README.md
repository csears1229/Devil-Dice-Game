# Devil-Dice-Game

Welcome! This is one of the very first projects I ever made in a Computer Science class. This game took me a few
days to figure out but I had a blast making it work. This is one of the projects that made me fall in love with 
software development and C++. I enjoyed playing with the logic to make it work correctly and figuring out how to 
loop and do calculations. 

## Rules

The rules of this game are simple. You are playing a game of dice with the computer (the devil). The first to bank 100 points
is the winner. You take turns rolling until you choose to bank your points or you roll a 1. If you roll a 1 you lose all of 
your points for that turn. Good luck!
